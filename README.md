In this repo, there are tasks I did under The Sparks Foundation Organization. 
Task #2 is the regression task in which the percentage score of the student is predicted based upon the number of hours he/she studied. This is a simple linear regression model involving two variables, 'Hours' as independent variable and 'Percentage Score' as dependent variable.
