In this repo, there are tasks I did under The Sparks Foundation Organization. 


Task #2 is the regression task in which the percentage score of the student is predicted based upon the number of hours he/she studied. This is a simple linear regression model involving two variables, 'Hours' as independent variable and 'Percentage Score' as dependent variable. 


Task #3 is the exploration of unsupervised Machine Learning. We can  use  clustering methods such as K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering , Mean Shift Clustering , Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) , etc. Here K Means Clustering is used. The number of optimum clusters is found alongwith the data visualization.
